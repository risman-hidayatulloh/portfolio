## Portfolio Website For Developers 💯


Portfolio for developers is a simple and minimalistic website to showcase your skills and projects as a developer. The design is inspired by [Manu Arora](https://manuarora.in/). The website is completely Open Source, you can use it for whatever purpose you want.

# Features ⚡️

- Responsive layout, works well on both Mobile and Desktop
- Dark mode support. Click buttons to toggle dark mode and light mode.
- Clear React components and tailwind styling.
- Exact sections that a developer needs to showcase their skills.
- Clear call to actions.

# Pages 📝

I've kept the pages as simple as possible. Only the required sections are included with minimal content.

# Tech Stack 📦️ 
The website is built in my favourite Tech Stack and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for building React Components.
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.
